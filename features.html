             <h1>Speed</h1>
             <div class="Features-description">
             </div>
              <div class="Features-text">
             <p>The computer can work very fast. It takes some seconds to calculate the complex numerical problem. The normal human being is never able to compete with the speed of the computer system. The computer can perform billions of instructions per second. We can measure the speed of the computer in terms of microsecond or nanosecond so that we cannot imagine the processing speed of the computer. The speed rate of the computer depends on its processor. We can measure the speed of our computer processor in hertz and Gigahertz.</p>
                 <br>
                 <br>

                 <h1>Accuracy</h1>
             <div class="Features-description">
             </div>
              <div class="Features-text">
             <p>The accuracy level of the computer is very high. The errors come in the computer due to inaccurate human input. The computer is never creating a mistake; it shows the error if the user gave the wrong data to the computer. The computers do not get tired or bored like us; they can do the same task repetitively with the same accuracy.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
            </div>
             <h1> Storage</h1>
         <div class="Features-description">
         </div>
          <div class="Features-text">
         <p>The computer has its internal memory, which is known as primary memory. We can store the vast amount of data in that memory. We can also save the data in secondary storage devices such as pen drive, floppy disk, compact disk, etc.</p>
         <br>
         <br>
        </div>
         <h1> Versatility</h1>
     <div class="Features-description">
     </div>
      <div class="Features-text">
     <p>Versatility means the performance of the computer. When we are doing a different task at the same time, the computer can do these tasks correctly. We can say that human is confused by doing many tasks at the same time, but we can do these things with the help of a computer.

        The computer has high Versatility, and for example, when we prepare our payroll slips at the same, we can make the electric bills. It is not only used to calculate numeric values, but it can also be used in various fields like medical, scientific experiments, multimedia, etc. </p>
        <h1>Reliability</h1>
        <div class="Features-description">
        </div>
         <div class="Features-text">
        <p>There are various types of components that exist in the computer system, such as motherboard, keyboard, mouse, etc. These components are very reliable and easy to use. The computer can execute billions of tasks in second. 

            The reliability is an attribute of the computer system. If a program is executed many numbers of times with the same set of data, every time the result would be the same: that is possible due to its reliability feature.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
           </div>
           <h1> Automation</h1>
           <div class="Features-description">
           </div>
            <div class="Features-text">
           <p>Automation is the feature of the computer system. It performs the task which is previously instructed by humans. For example, if we want to print some pages through the printer so, we have to give instruction once to the computer to print the pages. We do not need to instruct, again and again, the work will continue automatically.</p>
               <br>
               <br>
              </div>
              <h1> Logical</h1>
              <div class="Features-description">
              </div>
               <div class="Features-text">
              <p>The computer is not able to think and take the decision itself. It can take logical decision with the help of programs which are written in different languages. The logical feature of the computer is also used in the scientific and industrial calculation, where the extended range of data is used for information.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 </div>
                 <h1>No IQ</h1>
                 <div class="Features-description">
                 </div>
                  <div class="Features-text">
                 <p>The computer has no IQ level, like humans. It does not work without human instruction and does not have its intelligence power. The computer is not able to make decisions.</p>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    </div>
                    <h1> No feeling</h1>
                    <div class="Features-description">
                    </div>
                     <div class="Features-text">
                    <p>The computer does not have emotions, knowledge, experience, feeling, it works according to human desire and follow the instruction of humans.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                       <h1> Diligence</h1>
                       <div class="Features-description">
                       </div>
                        <div class="Features-text">
                       <p>The computer can work continuously without any break and creating error, and it never gets irritated with the work. The computer can reply again and again of similar things; still, it can produce an accurate result. </p>
