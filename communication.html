                         <p><b>Star networks </b> are one of the most common computer network topologies. In its simplest form, a star network consists of one central node, typically a switch or hub, which acts as a conduct to transmit messages. In star topology, every node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to a central node. The switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients.[</p>
