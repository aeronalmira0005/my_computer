                         <br>
                         <p><b>1. Manual Data Processing</b></p>
                         <br>
                         <li class="Data-List">in<b> manual data processing</b>data is processed manually without using any machine or tool to get required results. In manual data processing, all the calculations and logical operations are performed manually on the data. Similarly, data is transferred manually from one place to another. This method of data processing is very slow and errors may occur in the output. Mostly, is processed manually in many small business firms as well as government offices & institutions. In an educational institute, for example, marks sheets, fee receipts, and other financial calculations (or transactions) are performed by hand. This method is avoided as far as possible because of the very high probability of error, labor intensive and very time consuming. This type of data processing forms the very primitive stage when technology was not available or it was not affordable. With the advancement in technology the dependency on manual methods has drastically decreased.</li>
                         <br>
                         <p><b>2. Mechanical Data Processing</b></p>

                         <li class="Data-List">In<b> mechanical data processing </b> method, data is processed by using different devices like typewriters, mechanical printers or other mechanical devices. This method of data processing is faster and more accurate than manual data processing. These are faster than the manual mode but still forms the early stages of data processing. With invention and evolution of more complex machines with better computing power this type of processing also started fading away. Examination boards and printing press use mechanical data processing devices frequently.</li>
                         <br>

The data is processed through computer; Data and set of instructions are given to the computer as input and the computer automatically processes the data according to the given set of instructions. The computer is also known as electronic data processing machine.</li>
                         <br>

                         <li class="Data-List">Batch Processing is a method where the information to be organized is sorted into groups to allow for efficient and sequential processing. Online Processing is a method that utilizes Internet connections and equipment directly attached to a computer. It is used mainly for information recording and research. Real-Time Processing is a technique that has the ability to respond almost immediately to various signals in order to acquire and process information. Distributed Processing is commonly utilized by remote workstations connected to one big central workstation or server. ATMs are good examples of this data processing method.</li>

                         <li class="Data-List">This is a method that utilizes Internet connections and equipment directly attached to a computer. This allows for the data stored in one place and being used at altogether different place. Cloud computing can be considered as a example which uses this type of processing. It is used mainly for information recording and research.</li>

                         <br>
                         <p>i)<b> Report file</b>It contains a set of relatively permanent records extracted from the data in a master file.
                         <br>
                          <br>They are used to prepare reports, which can ve printed at a later date, e.g. report on student’s class performance in the term, extract of students who have not cleared their school fees, report on absentees </p>
                         <br>
                         <p> ii.)<b> Backup file</b> - Used to backup data or to hold duplicate copies of data/information from the computer’s fixed storage or main file for security purposes e.g. a copy of all the students admitted in a school fees, report on absentees</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>iii.)<b>Reference file </b> - Used for reference purposes. It contains records that are fairly permanent or semi-permanent, e.g. Deductions in caution money, wage rates, tax deductions, employees address, price lists etc.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>iv.)<b>Sort file</b> – used to sort/rank data according to a given order, e.g. ranking position in a class of students. </p>
                         <br>
                         <p> v.)<b>Transaction file  </b>- Is used to hold input data during transaction processing. It is later used to update master files and audits daily, weekly or monthly transaction. </p>

                         <br>
                         <ol>
                            <li class="Data-List">It is the way records are arranged (laid out) within a particular file or any secondary storage device in a computer</li>
                            <li class="Data-List">Refers to the way data is stored in a file</li>
                            <li class="Data-List">File organization is important because it determines the method of access, efficiency, flexibility and storage devices to be used.</li>

                         <p><b>Methods of file organization</b></p>
                         <br>
                         <p> i.)<b>Sequential and serial </b></p>
                         <br>
                         <p>in<b> sequential</b>file organization, records are stored in a sorted order using a </p>
                         <br>
                         <p>key field, while in <b>serial; </b>the records are stored in the order they come into the file, and are not sorted in any way.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>ii.)<b>Random and indexed-sequential</b></p>
                         <br>
                         <p>In random file organization, records are stored in the file randomly and accessed directly, while in indexed –sequential, the records are stored sequentially but accessed directly using an index.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>iii.)<b>serial file organization</b></p>
                         <br>
                         <p>Records are in a file are stored and accessed one after another on a storage medium</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>iv.)<b>Indexed sequencial file organization method </b></p>
                         <br>
                         <p>Similar to sequential method, only that an index is used to enable the computer to locate individual records on the storage media. </p>
                         <br>
                         <p><b> ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING MODES</b></p>
                         <br>
                         <p>This is the ways in which a computer under the influence of an operating system is designed to process data eg
                         <br> <b>a) Batch processing</b> is the execution of a series of jobs in a program on a computer without manual intervention (non-interactive). Strictly speaking, it is a processing mode: the execution of a series of programs each on a set or "batch" of inputs, rather than a single input (which would instead be a custom job). However, this distinction has largely been lost, and the series of steps in a batch process are often called a "job" or "batch job".</p>
                         <br>
                         <p><b>Batch processing has these benefits:= </b></p>
                         <br>
                         <li class="Data-List"> It can shift the time of job processing to when the computing resources are less busy.</li>
                         <li class="Data-List"> It avoids idling the computing resources with minute-by-minute manual intervention and supervision.</li>
                         <li class="Data-List">By keeping high overall rate of utilization, it amortizes the computer, especially an expensive one. </li>
                         <li class="Data-List"> It allows the system to use different priorities for interactive and non-interactive work</li>
                         <li class="Data-List">Rather than running one program multiple times to process one transaction each time, batch processes will run the program only once for many transactions, reducing system overhead. </li>
                         <br>
                         <p><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
                         <li class="Data-List">  Users are unable to terminate a process during execution, and have to wait until execution completes.</li>
